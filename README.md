## Cloud Career Advice Blog

### Interested in Cybersecurity or Cloud Security? 

If you are interested in exploring the Cybersecurity profession there are MANY different paths to start on. The Cyber landscape is has atleast 15 -20 different specialities within it. It usually falls within a few buckets this is how I viewed it - Blue Team, Purple Team, Red Team and Technical Security. If you need to start at the first block then I recommend taking the CompTIA Security+ exam because it does give you an overall view of this industry. 

Blue Team is the SOC team, the incident responders. 

Red Team made up of folks who love to break things, the hackers.

Purple Team is where I group the most amount of specialities including threat, inteligence, risk & audit, control and other goverance work.

Technical Security is how I'd explain the group of folks who are more focused on the programing/ technical work think DevOps, Security Engineers IAM.

#### I recommend looking into these certifications:
If you want to enter the cybersecurity space check out Security+. Network+ is overlooked but the basis of alot of security work is truly understanding how computers talk to each other. I'd also recommend the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate because the information is very beginner friendly. 

If you want to learn about cloud you need to review the 101 content for Azure, GCP and AWS. Pick one and look into their basic certification. The key is picking one to dive deep into!

#### I recommend understanding these addtional resources:
Know what they mean, it will make you sound smarter speaking with more experience Cyber/Information Security professionals.
- MITRE
- Terraform
- ISACA
- OWASP
- Kubernetes
- Splunk
  
#### I recommend looking into these conferences:
Bsides conferences are the cheapest of cyber events and there are many local ones! 

DefCon my favorite! A wonderful event that gathers fellow cyber nerds!

WiCyS is Women in Cybersecurity a global organization that hosts a great annual conference and year round events.
